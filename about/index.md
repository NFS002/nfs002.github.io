*Written in March 2020*

I am a student in my final year of an undergraduate degree studying computer dcience at St. Andrews university, and I created this website to have a platform to blog and talk about subjects and other topics that interest me.
I have a long standing interest in financial services and investment strategy and I loke to experiment with demo account and small stakes exploring new features on different trading platforms using technical anaylsis and quantative modelling. Id be very keen to consider a graduate role developing machine learning, multimedia processing, and other froms and big data analytics as a form of investment strategy, and Ive found some of the ways in which this has happened to be exiciting and innovative.

I followed closely the ICO boom and huge growth in crytocurrencies and ditributed ledger technologies in 2017,
and look out for news updates from various channels and sources. In general, I am always interested in hearing about and understanding new technologies, and the opportunities and possibilities they present. I really enjoy my degree and the different modules and classes I have the opportunity to take, and programming assignments in particular.
