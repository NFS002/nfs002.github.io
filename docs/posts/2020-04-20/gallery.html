<p>Im writing about this project before I actually implement it, which is not how i usually do things, but ill udate this post when I do actually finish it. A few of my family members are quite ‘artsy’ and they are creative and can draw and paint well. I enjoy art a lot but thats where the story ends. A lot of their college and school friends would also consider themselves upcoming artists and also produce some amazing stuff. Recently, there was a week organised around the area in north London where I live in which all sort of different artists (painters, sculptors, potters, photographers, etc…) exhbited their own work in a gallery based inside their own homes (e.g in the TV room), so that anyone could knock on their door and have a look around the exhibition. The art mostly was for sale, but the exhibition itself was free. Details of all the artists and exhibitions were posted on a centralised website beforehand, so people could plan their trip and in what order to visit different houses. The rise of the ‘gig economy’ and different P2P platforms that connects end users offering all sorts of paid services (e.g Uber, AirBnB, Deliveroo) inspired me to design and implement a similar platform where upoming artists could either pay someone else to home-exhibit, or home-exhibit themselves. Anyone running a gallery from their own home may be hosting work from multiple different artists, and similarly a new artist could exhibit someone elses work, earning money for doing so and also gaining exposure by having people come and view their work who were may have only been initially interetsed in the more well known artist. This platform would be available as a website and possible a mobile app, that could connect artists and exhibitors from different cities, and also simulatenously serve as a hub where anyone can find information and the address of home-galleries and exhibitions near them, and also search for particular artists.</p>
