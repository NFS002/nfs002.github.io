Donut Stones is a ERC20 cryptocurrency I have started that aims to solve the problem of the (donut economy)[https://doughnuteconomics.org/about-doughnut-economics] 
and the limits to economic growth. The solidity code is open sourced on my [github](https://www.github.com/nfs002/donut-stones) and a link to the crowdsale website is below. Ive had some great feedback already on this one and its an extremely important cause so im hoping to develop it further.
