## A scalable taxi dispatch system

Last semester, I took a class in distributed systems. One of the assignements was to design and implement 
a system which integrates as a component in the backend of an uber-like ( mobile taxi dispatch ) system. 
As specifications go, it was about as vague as it gets, but the words 'middleware' and 'message-queue' were said quite a bit. 

Ubers current system they use to connect and organise mobile network of consumers and drivers is called DISCO, which is an anagram for something about dispatch optimisation. Theres a pretty detailed blog post about it<a href="https://medium.com/@narengowda/uber-system-design-8b2bc95e2cfe"> here, </a> but essentially its supported by a giant infrastruture and terabytes of data. 

For this piece of coursework, I essentially developed my own version of this system using <a href="https://grpc.io/"> gRPC </a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer)"> the chord protocol (a distributed hash table).</a> Alongside each piece of coursework we must submit a report detailing how to build and run the program, along with our design decisions and possible improvements. Below is my  offical report for the coursework, and I have open sourced the project also:
