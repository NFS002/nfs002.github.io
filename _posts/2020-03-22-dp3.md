This will be a short post about a command line tool I wrote to extract and download mp3 streams from youtube videos. I wrote it for myself primarly because I listen to a lot of music and theres a lot of tracks on youtube which you cant get on spotify or other streaming apps.
General usage:
``` $ dp3 search <regex>|[url] <file_name>  ```

The path to the folder in which the files are saved is set in a configuration file.

Examples:

 ```$ dp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaCd3YrEteE "Kudasai - Technicolor" ```

 ```$ dp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaCd3YrEteE ```

```$ dp3 search shiloh ```

I wrote this in python 3, trying not to use too many external dependencies, and <a href="https://www.github.com/nfs002/downloadmp3"> its available to clone or download on my github page. </a> Ive verified it on MAC OS Mojave and Ubuntu 18.04 but I can vouch for Windows.
