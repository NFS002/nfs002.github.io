E-Voting has been offered in Estonia for national elections since 2005, but amid a lot of controversy and ridicule. Other smaller state elections in the U.S and around the world have also made attempts at web-based voting, but definetely regretted the decision afterwards. Its fair to say that its not really a thing. Reliable and secure electronic voting seems like a bit of holy grail. Everyone is in agreement that it would be a positive development to the electoral systems themselves, but similarly every computer scientist and security researcher has warned against the sheer impossibility of guaranteeing against all possible security flaws vulnerabilities. A successful system would have to meet an unparalleled standard, and cryptography only goes so far. As of yet, these are some of the key remaining hurdles.

#### DDos mitigation
It goes without saying why we need to be able to guarantee immunity from DDos attacks, although this in itself isnt really the problem, since many network providers are genuinely able to provide such a service.  Traditionally, most CDN and cloud networks rely on full-proxy, symmetric protection. But that requires full decryption of SSL communications before it is scrubbed, thereby adding latency and violating user privacy.

Other solutions include behavioral and rate-based paramaters, or the <a href="https://www.radware.com/solutions/ssl-protection/">unique keyless hybrid solution offered by Radware.</a>

#### Confidentiality
Confidentiality in computer networks refers to protecting information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. In the case of e-voting, this translates as only the voter should be able to know who they voted for. The vote server(s), where votes are collected and counted, should be able to validate and see the value of each vote, but not associate that vote back to the original voter, and all other parties should not be able to discern either. In traditional voting, Confidentiality is done easily through physical seperation, but in computer networks this is usually achieved through a combination of cryptographic hash functions, D-H key exchanges, and assymetric keys. Some propososed systems try to mimmick this seperationwith geographically remote servers for the different processes of voter registration, vote sorting, collecting and counting. Crucially, communication between these different processes is restricted. 

#### Anonymity and privacy
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThreeBallot">ThreeBallot</a> is a conceptual system with some intersting security features, and in my own design I have simplified and slightly adapated the basic components of ThreeBallot to extract only the most crucial properties of voter <b>privacy</b> and <b>anonymity.</b> Similar to confidentiality, voter anonymity in this case would ensure that inspecting the content and value of any single vote would not reveal the identity of the voter. In traditional manual systems, we dont need to write our names on votes so this is not a problem, but in electronic systems, each vote must be <b>authenticated</b> as belonging to a legitimate registered voter by marking the network packet containing the vote with some preconfigured identifier. It is problematic for a vote to be both authenticated and anonmymous but in this NBallot system, each voter votes in total n times ( where n is the number of candidates ), but (n - 1) of these votes will be redundant, and the remaining vote indicates the 'real' choice of candidate. How exactly votes are indicated as redundant could vary accoriding to implememtation, and in the original ThreeBallot system used negative voting,but in my own design, there is some key (in addition to any other encryption) that can only be interpreted by the vote collecting server and may be preconfigured at the time of voter registration. Since inspecting a single vote doesnt reveal anything about the 'real' choice of candidate, we could use the preferred form of SSL proxy DDos mitigation.

#### Integrity
Integrity, in the context of computer systems, refers to methods of ensuring that data is real,accurate and safeguarded from unauthorized user modification. With traditional paper balloting and hand counting, the entire process is not only clearly visible to those observing it, but it is also easily understandable to the average voter. The ballot box can be shown to be empty at the start of voting by polling staff, then sealed, observed in the polling station to ensure that only legitimate voters are putting in ballots, and at the end of voting the seal can be broken and the ballots counted in full view of observers. Therefore, most previous work on guaranteeing integrity in e-voting systems tries to promote transparency and verifiability as tools for ensuring the integrity of votes. <b>Transparency</b> refers to how easily third parties may observe and monitor that each counting and sorting process is completed correctly.
<b>Verifiability</b> has two meanings: At the individual level, all voters should be able to
verify that their votes have been correctly recorded and have been correctly included into the tally. At the universal level, anyone in the world should be able to verify the integrity of the tallying result, based on publicly available audit data. So while ensuring that voting and counting technologies are transparent does not alone guarantee that technologies will generate accurate results, it does provide the space and tools to do so. Audit trails and voter receipts are the usual mechanisms. However, in other aspects of computer network security, crypytographic hash functions, checksums and MAC codes can be used to prove that a message has been tampered or subject to MiTM attacks. The possibility of retransmission or restoring from a back-up copy must exists in this case. In NBallot, It seems we could that we could say with a high degree of certainty that votes have at least not been tampered or corrupted in transmission because any third party know could not know how to intepret the decoy keys, and which vote represents a genuine choice. Selecting a packet in the group at random and modifying its value would also fail, since each group of n votes must be authenticated by the collecting server as conforming to the rules and format of the NBallot system. Each decoy key must be unique in that group, and each group of decoy keys is chosen by the voter at registration time, and recorded by the server. In any of these keys have been modified, or any other formatting constraint fails, the whole group is void and should be retransmitted.
<b>Voter registration</b> is a prerequisite to voting whereby each personE who wishes to vote must register their intention with the electoral authorities, similar to the process of registering to vote in any election. The difference is that, in this system, each voter receives a unique identification number (Voter ID), which is then used to compute a digital signature on all of their network votes. After the election, all voter IDs and their chosen candidates could be posted on a public website. Without sacrificing voter privacy, each individual voter could verify that their own vote had been correctly recorded, and any third party may check that all votes has been counted and sorted correctly, and the correct candidate elected. The process of secure voter registration is complex and is detailed later.






 
The security requirements of such a system come in many forms, and was always going to be a major issue, but cryptography can only so far. For example, any reliable system necessity will have to be able to secure and not vulnerable to DDos attacks. Network providers like Cloudflare, Akamai, or Emblaze do provide such a service, but at the unacceptable cost of unencrypted packet inspection. 

The implementation was suppossed to satisfy coursework requirements, and so parts of it could definitely be improved. For example, my own shoddy implementation of SSL.

This system can be roughly divided into 5 temporal stages, as shown in figure 1.3 below. 
1. #### Before registration
    All services are unavailable, other than information on where/when to register.
2. #### Registration
    On receiving any request, the server passes the request to a timer gateway (which holds information about the designated registration time) and which look will the current time, and then either reject the client, or forward it to the registration service (probably on the same physical server) if the request is made within the registration hour. The request message is then read in full, validated and parsed. A valid request can only be a key request at this stage, where the clients ID number, configured in a configuration file or something (indicating that this client id allowed to register) is sent as a header with the request. An internal dictionary data structure, is checked to see if this ID has already made a previous failed or succesfull request, and a new nonce is generated and sent back to the client, along with the public key of the server accordingly.
3. #### Transfer Time
    The mapping from ID numbers of registered voters to nonces is hashed (each ID number and nonce is hashed individually, so the map retains its structure) and the result is sent to the authentication
    server.
4. #### Voting hour
    Similar to the registration hour, a timer gateway will only accept the request if it is made within the voting hour.
    When a vote is requested, the message must contain 4 headers: Hash(ID),
    Hash(Nonce), Hash(ID, Nonce, pubkey(Vote)) - i.e the MAC code, and pubkey(vote).
    The hashed ID and nonce are checked to see if they are included in the mapping it received from the registration server. If they are, the encrypted vote is succesfully extracted from the message (whilst still encrypted), and the mapping is removed from the list.
5. #### After voting
    After Voting hour, the data the list of encrypted votes is sent back to the
    registration server, which then decrypts each of them individually,
    and sorts the list to find the winner.

In total there are 3+ registration servers, and a single voting server. Every client has to register with all registration servers to receives the public key of each server, and once they have registered, they must vote as many times as there registration servers, each vote in its own request and encryted with a different public key.  Each registration server then maintains a list of all clients registered on that server, and then only common entries on all registration lists will be authorised to vote. There can infact be any number of registration servers, but the more there are, the more confidently we can cofirm the true identity of the client as being on the list of pre-configured authorised voters, because, similar to 2FA, each potential voter would be told about the location and time of registration hour on each registration server via a different medium of communication. Since the the client must repeat their vote for as many registration servers as there are, each vote must be for the same candidate in order for it to be counted, and even if any two of the registration servers did communicate with each other to try and work out who had voted for who, they could not without the cooperation of all others. In conbination with an HMAC tag on each repeated vote, as the number of registration servers increases, the possibility or threat of fabrication or modification becomes negligible.
