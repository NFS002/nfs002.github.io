# Swimp3

This mini-project is so simple in fact it hardly deserves its own post, but its a bit of programming I did partly for fun and partly to solve a practical problem I faced in my daily life so in that sense it seems fair enough to write at least a little bit about it.

Swimp3 is a simple CLI program written in python that can either create a new randomly generated spotify playlist (given a larger 'seed' playlist to make a subselection from), and then download that playlust, or just directly download the given playlist to a collection of mp3 files.

Im using a third party library [(spotdl)](https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader) to interact with the spotify API so this is really not a big deal. I use it because I go swimming quite a lot (much less in the winter) and I have some underwater headphones to listen to music or podcasts while I swim, which really does give me a lot of motivation and make the whole experience more enjoyable.

The basic usage is:

```
Swimp3 [-h] --playlist-id PLAYLIST_ID [--seed] [--path PATH] [--length LENGTH]
```

As always, the project is [opensourced and available on my GitHub](https://github.com/nfs002/swimp3)
